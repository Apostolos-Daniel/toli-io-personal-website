I talked about [Observable systems with serverless](https://www.meetup.com/devsconnect/events/282326885/) at [Devs Connect](https://www.meetup.com/devsconnect/).

✅ I tried to show what observability looks like in a serverless world.

✅ I focused more on the instrumentation aspect of observability, and picked some examples of good dashboards.

✅ I ended with the (positive) impact the observability efforts had on the organisation.

Slide deck is published on the [meetup repo](https://github.com/Devs-Connect/dc003-observable-systems-and-ddd/blob/main/the_road_to_observable_systems_by_toli_apostolidis/the_road_to_observable_systems_by_toli_apostolidis.pdf).
