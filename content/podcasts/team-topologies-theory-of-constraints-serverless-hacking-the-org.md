I had the pleasure to be invited alongside one of my favourite ex-colleagues, [Andy Norton](https://twitter.com/andyjnorton), on one of my favourite new podcasts - [Hacking the org](https://blog.container-solutions.com/tag/hacking-the-org) podcast. 

What could go wrong?

We covered loads of topics and, honestly, we could talk for hours. Charles was a great host, asking contemporary and spot on questions.
