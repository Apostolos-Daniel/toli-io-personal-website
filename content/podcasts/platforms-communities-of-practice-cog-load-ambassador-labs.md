I had a chat on twitter with [@danieltbryantuk](https://twitter.com/danielbryantuk) about the role of an "internal Dev Rel", aka "Engineering Practice Lead" or "Principal Practice Engineer" in product engineering-centric companies. I was invited to speak with Daniel on his [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/4A8w8qB4ogp9JAk6tEqQn9) about all things software engineering culture, Communities of Practice & DevOps models. Daniel was a superb host and I thoroughly enjoyed the chat.
