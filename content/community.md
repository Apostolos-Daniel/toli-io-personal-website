I love being part of ✨communities of ideas and practices✨ that help us **grow and learn together**. Here are some of the ways I'm involved:

## Team Topologies

I'm proud to be a [Team Topologies Advocate](https://teamtopologies.com/all-tta/toli-apostolidis), helping teams understand and apply effective organizational patterns for fast flow.

If you are interested in learning more about Team Topologies, feel free to reach out to me at <fastflow@toli.io>. If you are interested in having me speak about Team Topologies, I'd love to hear from you.

I'd love to introduce new people into the program, so if you think you'd be a good fit, let me know.

## Datadog

I'm a **Datadog Ambassador**, promoting best practices in observability and monitoring.
