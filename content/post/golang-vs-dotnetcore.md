## My first public talk

A couple of months ago (January 2019) I did a couple of things for the first time:

- gave my first public talk
- used [beautiful.ai](https://www.beautiful.ai/-LWajhsgv-w9AyBs1ejg/1) for the first time to create the slide deck

I'm not sure what I was proud about most: the presentation itself or the tool I used to create the presentation.

### Beautiful.ai

It's probably not that obvious when seeing a screenshot but the whole process of creating a presentation using this tool has made it fun again. Don't get me wrong it takes time to get a sense of beauty and actually create beautiful slide decks but this is a start! And it has got me excited again when I start thinking about creating presentations.
