This talk is about our journey to a new tech stack in a different cloud (Azure ➡️ AWS). What was most interesting here was our journey to serverless via observability. [The Road to a New Architecture: Cinch’s Journey to Serverless](https://youtu.be/vlqxb7mIwBc) was part of [dash con](https://www.dashcon.io/) 2021.
