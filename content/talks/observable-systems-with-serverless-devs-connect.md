I talked about [Observable systems with serverless](https://www.meetup.com/devsconnect/events/282326885/) at [Devs Connect](https://www.meetup.com/devsconnect/).

❌ I did not delve into observability definitions and concepts: referred to the experts for this, e.g. [Charity Majors](https://charity.wtf/), [LightStep](https://opentelemetry.lightstep.com/)

❌ I did not cover all parts of the observability journey: monitors/alerts, SLOs, dashboards/monitors as code etc. were omitted

✅ I showed what observability looks like in a serverless world.

✅ I focused more on the instrumentation aspect of observability, and picked some examples of good dashboards.

✅ I ended with the (positive) impact the observability efforts had on the organisation.

The talk is published on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/nvbabK1Vr48).
