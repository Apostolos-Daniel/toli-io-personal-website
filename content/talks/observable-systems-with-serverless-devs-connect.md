[Observable systems with serverless](https://www.meetup.com/devsconnect/events/282326885/) talk was given as part of [Devs Connect](https://www.meetup.com/devsconnect/). I tried to show what observability looks like in a serverless world. I tried to focus more on the instrumentation aspect of observability. I picked some examples of good dashboards. I finished off with the impact the observability efforts had on the organisation.
