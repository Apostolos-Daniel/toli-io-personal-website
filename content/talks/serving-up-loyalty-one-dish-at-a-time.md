How many times have you been handed over a loyalty card from a restaurant or cafe you love? How many times have you then forgotten it or lost it when you next ordered from your favourite place? Independent restaurants are starving for time: all they want is an all-in-one solution, from initial configuration to reporting on the performance of their loyalty programme.

At the [Datadog London Summit](https://www.datadoghq.com/summit/london24/), I shared [our story](https://www.datadoghq.com/summit/london24/agenda/serving_up_customer_loyalty_one_dash_at_a_time/) of how we delivered a product for our restaurants while modernising our tech stack.
