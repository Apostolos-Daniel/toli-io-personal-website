## Hi

Welcome to my website. My full name is Apostolis Daniel Apostolidis, most people know me as **Toli**.

I'm currently working as a **Principal Engineer** specialising in everything **DevOps** and **Observability** at [cinch](https://www.cinch.co.uk), Manchester, UK.

## Software Development

I'm a Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Physics graduate - via a long process of feeling as an imposter for a few years, I am now a passionate software engineer - with a background in **C#**, .NET.

## Tech in the Community

I have a passion for learning; sharing what I've learned with friends and the community in general. In the past, I was a co-host of [Behind The Buzzword](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Behind-The-Buzz-Word) meetup in Manchester, UK.

## Political Debates

I'm actively involved in a local DSC of [DIEM25](https://diem25.org/). Fostering and advocating debates about Europe.

I'm also part of a transnational Greek thematic team exploring the phenomenon of [Brain Drain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_capital_flight) in Greece and Southern Europe in general. For Greek speakers, we've started a [Brain Drain podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/2Wd0cdlqEwPVQVB4vaEMc3?si=xTQWezCkT4igDTXehFTBTg).
