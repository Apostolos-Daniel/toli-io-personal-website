## üëã Hi

Welcome to my website. My full name is Apostolis Daniel Apostolidis. Most people know me as **Toli**.

I'm currently a Principal Engineer at a company called [FlipDish](www.flipdish.com), after working at [cinch](cinch.co.uk) for 3.5 years where I held several roles, with the last one being "Head of Engineering Practice".

## üíª Software Engineering

I love discovering what good, contemporary Engineering Practices look like. I have spent more than a decade as a Software Engineer, working across many software paradigms, stacks, and industries. I have since discovered the power of empowering teams and organisations working together.

## üó∫Ô∏è Tech in the Community

I have a passion for learning; sharing what I've learned with friends and the community in general. You might come across my [talks](talks) at Conferences or Meetups or on [podcasts](podcasts).

 > If you are interested in inviting me for a talk or a podcast, feel free to reach out at <talks@toli.io>.

  In the past, I was a co-host of [Behind The Buzzword](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Behind-The-Buzz-Word) meetup in Manchester, UK.

## üéì Education

I studied what I loved since a kid - Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Physics. Spent 4 amazing years learning about so many amazing fields of Mathematics in Patra, Greece. Spent my final year at University, undertaking an MSc in Mathematical Sciences at Durham University, UK.

## üèÄ Basketball

I spent most of my life playing basketball at an elite level as a junior and semi-professionally thereafter. I coached U16s for a few years in Nottingham, UK.

## ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Political Debates

I'm actively involved in a local DSC of [DIEM25](https://diem25.org/). Fostering and advocating debates about Europe.

I'm also part of a transnational Greek thematic team exploring the phenomenon of [Brain Drain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_capital_flight) in Greece and Southern Europe in general. For Greek speakers, we've started a [Brain Drain podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/2Wd0cdlqEwPVQVB4vaEMc3?si=xTQWezCkT4igDTXehFTBTg).
