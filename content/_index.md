## ðŸ‘‹ Hey

I'm glad you're here! I'm Apostolis Daniel Apostolidis, but you can call me **Toli**â€”that's what most people do. ðŸ˜Š

I enjoy giving talks about Software Engineering, I occasionally write on here or on [Medium](https://medium.com/@tolisapostolidis). I only started engaging with people outside my immediate circle in 2019, and I've been loving it ever since. I'm always up for a chat, so feel free to reach out to me on any of the social platforms or [via email](mailto:me@toli.io).
