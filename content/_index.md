I work in **software engineering**, with a background in Mathematics and a life-long soft spot for basketball. I'm passionate about building resilient, **observable**, and maintainable systems. For these reasons, I'm a fan of **serverless**, event-driven architectures, DevOps, systems thinking, and observability. I've worked **with and within teams** of all sizes, from startups to large enterprises, and I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly.
