I grew up in Greece, I have lived the majority of my adult life in the UK and I am 1/2 Greek, 1/2 British. Hence, why I call myself "Citizen of Nowhere" (it's a great book, if you've not read it yet).

## üíª My Software Engineering Story

Ever since 2011, I've been on an exciting journey as a Software Engineer, diving into different software paradigms, stacks, and industries. My true passion lies in discovering what contemporary, effective engineering practices look like‚Äîand more importantly, in empowering teams and organizations to thrive together.

I currently work as a Principal Engineer at [Flipdish](www.flipdish.com), an Irish company creating easy-to-use tech solutions for independent restaurants. Before this, I spent 3.5 incredible years at [cinch](cinch.co.uk), where I took on various roles, culminating in Head of Engineering Practice. Œô started out my career at IFS, a global enterprise software company, where I worked for 7 years on the IFS Schedule Optimisation systems.

## üó∫Ô∏è I like to learn & sharing

Learning and sharing knowledge is what energizes me. Whether it's through [speaking](talks) at Conferences, Meetups, or appearing on [podcasts](podcasts), I'm always up for engaging with various communities. If you're interested in having me speak or collaborate on a podcast, I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out at <talks@toli.io>.

In the past, I co-hosted the [Behind The Buzzword](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Behind-The-Buzz-Word) meetup in Manchester, UK. It was so much fun and rewarding to bring together people from different backgrounds to discuss tech topics.

## üéì My Academic Journey

Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by mathematics. I pursued Maths by studying Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Physics at the University of Patras in Greece. Later, I moved to the UK for even more Maths, via an MSc in Mathematical Sciences at Durham University in the UK. Those years were full of incredible learning and exploration in the world of mathematics.

## üèÄ My Love for Basketball

Basketball has been a huge part of my life. I played at an elite level as a junior and continued semi-professionally in Greece. I even had the pleasure of coaching juniors for a few years in Nottingham, UK. The basketball court has always been a place where I find joy, sollace and discipline.
